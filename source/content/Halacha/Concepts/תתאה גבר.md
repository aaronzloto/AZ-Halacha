When something hot comes into contact with something cold, whether the hot item heats the cold item or the cold item cools the hot item, the consequence being whether the items cook together and thereby transfer flavors to each other, is debated in the Gemara (source). We Pasken that whichever item is lower (although according to many this is actually interpreted to mean the stationary item) extends its state to the upper (moving) item (תתאה גבר). ^ad0c62
