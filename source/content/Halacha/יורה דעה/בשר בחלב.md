### The Prohibition:
The Torah prohibits [[בישול - Cooking#^8df37a|cooking]] meat and milk together, and prohibits the product of such cooking from being eaten or benefitted from.  (ש"ע יו"ד פז:א)

The derivation for this law is as follows: the Torah writes (שמות כג:יט, שם לד:כו, דברים יד:כא) לא תבשל גדי בחלב אמו (Thou shalt not cook a goat in its mother's milk) three times. The ברייתא says (:גמ' חולין קטו) that the Torah wrote this פסוק three times in order to prohibit cooking (1), eating (2), and benefitting from (3) a combination of meat and milk.

The רשב"א teaches (:ת"ה הקצר ב"ג ש"ד פד) an important caveat: the Torah only prohibits eating and benefitting from a combination of meat and milk that has been cooked together. He derives this from the fact that all three פסוקים use the language of "don't cook," even though two of them are referring to eating and benefit, respectively.

It is important to note that this only constitutes an absolute permit to *benefit* from a meat/milk combination that has not been cooked together, *eating* such a combination, on the other hand, is prohibited מדרבנן. As well, benefitting from any other meat/milk combination that is only prohibited מדרבנן (see below) is allowed. (רמ"א בהגה יו"ד פז:א) 

### Definitions:
There are three terms that must be defined in order to understand the prohibition of בשר בחלב: cooking, meat, and milk.

#### Cooking: 
In the context of בשר בחלב, cooking has two definitions: a general definition of causing flavor to transfer, and a specific definition of cooking in water or other liquids. When the Torah prohibits cooking meat and milk, it means the second definition of cooking in water (when heated by a flame, not the sun or hot springs, עי' שו"ע יו"ד פז:ו), [[#Roasting (צלי)|roasting]], smoking, putting cold meat into hot mil or vice versa (שם ב"ה ס"ק ב בשם פ"ח) and pan-frying (שם פ"ת ס"ק ג בשם פ"ח).

There is debate about all of the above cooking methods except cooking itself:
###### Roasting (צלי): 
There is some debate whether roasting בשר בחלב is prohibited מדאורייתא or only מדרבנן.
The פרי חדש is of the opinion that it is מדאורייתא (see יו"ד ס' ס"ק ב for his proofs.)
The 
###### Smoking:
There is a debate about what kind of smoking is referred to here. It can either mean hot smoking, in a situation where the heat is indirect, or it can mean cold smoking, i.e. sawdust is burned to create a large amount of smoke in an enclosed space and the meat and cheese would be in contact, the smoke would cause flavor to transfer between them. 
###### Cold into Hot:
![[תתאה גבר#^ad0c62]]

As a consequence of this, when cold milk falls onto hot meat or vice versa, according to many this would be considered akin to roasting, as the hot base would heat the cold item falling onto it, causing flavors to transfer between them, rendering the mixture בשר בחלב.
###### Pan-Frying:
R' Lefkowitz told me that deep frying is considered cooking, not frying.
#### Meat:
Meat is the flesh of a living creature. As such, there are five categories of meat, respectively the flesh of a:
###### Domesticated Animal (בהמה):
In the context of בשר בחלב, only the meat of a kosher domesticated animal (בהמה טהורה) is prohibited מדאורייתא.
###### Wild Animal (חיה):
###### Bird (עוף):
###### Fish (דג):
Fish are מעיקר הדין permitted to be eaten with either meat or milk, but they are practically prohibited from being eaten with meat (for אשכנזים), due to a סכנה. () 

The ב"י adds () that there is also a סכנה when they are combined with milk. Because of this, ספרדים will not eat fish with milk either. 

The רמ"א says () that this ב"י must be due to a printing error, as the source that the ב"י quotes says fish and *meat*, not milk.
###### Grasshopper (חגב):
Technically this category should be insects, but grasshoppers ([only certain species](https://ohr.edu/ask_db/ask_main.php/19/Q1/)) are the only kosher insects. Because this is the case, there is no halachic term that I am aware of that refers to insects and includes grasshoppers as well.

Grasshoppers are like [[#Fish (דג)|fish]] in that they are מעיקר הדין permitted to be eaten with either meat or milk, but differ from fish in that there is no סכנה concern associated with their combination with either meat or milk. ()
